# Squeezebox-Soundbar
Portable Squeezebox player using a bluetooth sound bar and a1S audio kit board


This project was looking at a low cost solution for a portable head-less squeezebox player.  Using an existing production bluetooth player is cost-effective alternative to buying speaker box components (as a bonus it came iwht a decent battery and holder too!)

The current solution uses a a1s audio kit.  It works well but required a pretty ugly add on box.  The idea would be to use smaller components to fit into the existing compartment.  In theory, the display can be replaced with a modifiecd cap/case.

## Deconstruction
I resorted to brute force and a hack-saw to het into the first unit.  
The correct method (in retrospect!) is to peel back the display sticker to access 2 screws mounting the display module cover to the main extrusion.  If these are removed, you may beable to pry open the other5 side to access the left screws.  Once these are removed, I am suuming the cap with the electronucs assembly should come off as easily as the speaker end cao.
