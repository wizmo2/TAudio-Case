# t_Audio Squeezelite-esp32

_NOTE:  These are the build files I currently run.  They are offered without support!_

These builds are the current version I run on my T-Audio devices.  For up to date releases see https://github.com/sle118/squeezelite-esp32

To install these, I uploaded the bin files to a local web-server and used the UI to update them directly.  

I have NOT tested the zip version
