# General Notes.
I trimmed the rear IO header to prevent interference with the 1200mA battery (see why below)

The T9 board has nearly everything that you need, although there are a couple of issues.
- The I2c header shares a pin with the LED strip.
- The speaker output (disappointingly) needs an external amplifier.    
-  The main IO header pins are a little too short for standard jumpers and connectors ( I assume there is a low profile connector out there somewhere). For the final unit, I soldered  external connections to the header mounting tabs.
-  Most of the exposed IO have pullup resistors pre-installed. (I struggled to get the OLED SPI interface to work without modified code - although it may just be the board I was using)

I haven't yet found a suitable speaker for a "speaker cap" option (as mentioned, will need a driver amp board as well)
