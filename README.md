## Details
This project was designed for a Squeezelite-ESP32 project used with Home-Assistant as an audio and visual notification device.

### Configuration

For squeezelite-esp32 configuration use "I2S Dac" audio output mode (or Bluetooth)

| Hardware Options | NVS Key | Value |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DAC | dac_config | model=WM8978,bck=33,ws=25,do=26,sda=19,scl=18,i2c=26 |
| Led Strip | led_vu_config | WS2812,length=19,gpio=22 |
| | bat_config | channel=7,scale=6.8,atten=3,cells=1 |
| | actrls_config | buttons (see below) }

Suggested configuration for buttons using one of the display caps.  (The navigation is a little fiddly, but useable in a crunch)
```
buttons 
[{"gpio":34,"type":"BUTTON_LOW","pull":true,"long_press":600, "normal":{"pressed":"ACTRLS_VOLDOWN"}, "longpress":{"pressed":"ACTRLS_PREV"}},  {"gpio":39,"type":"BUTTON_LOW","pull":true,"long_press":600, "normal":{"pressed":"ACTRLS_VOLUP"}, "longpress":{"pressed":"ACTRLS_NEXT"}},  {"gpio":36,"type":"BUTTON_LOW","pull":true,"long_press":600, "normal":{"pressed":"ACTRLS_TOGGLE"}, "longpress":{"pressed":"buttons_nav"}} ]

buttons_nav
[{"gpio":34,"type":"BUTTON_LOW","pull":true,"long_press":600, "normal":{"pressed":"BCTRLS_DOWN"}, "longpress":{"pressed":"BCTRLS_LEFT"}},  {"gpio":39,"type":"BUTTON_LOW","pull":true,"long_press":600, "normal":{"pressed":"BCTRLS_UP"}, "longpress":{"pressed":"BCTRLS_RIGHT"}},  {"gpio":36,"type":"BUTTON_LOW","pull":true,"long_press":600, "normal":{"pressed":"ACTRLS_PLAY"}, "longpress":{"pressed":"buttons"}} ]
```
Note: Do not set the "green" GPIO option as it shares gpio with the Led strip

## General Notes.
I trimmed the rear IO header to prevent interference with the 1200mA battery (see why it doesn't really matter below).  With a different 1250mAh battery, it was not necessary. 

The T9 board has nearly everything that you need, although there are a couple of issues.
- The I2c header shares a pin with the LED strip.
- The speaker output (disappointingly) needs an external amplifier.    
-  The main IO header pins are a little too short for standard jumpers and connectors ( I assume there is a low profile connector out there somewhere). For the final unit, I soldered  external connections to the header mounting tabs.
-  Most of the exposed IO have pullup resistors pre-installed. (I struggled to get the OLED SPI interface to work without modified code - although it may just be the board I was using)

I haven't yet found a suitable speaker for a "speaker cap" option (as mentioned, will need a driver amp board as well)
